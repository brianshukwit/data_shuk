The name keto comes from that diet that doesn't eat sugar, which keto_database is a database I made to house historical data that came from SugarCRM. 
So since we no longer had sugar we were sugarfree you could say...
I created all the tables/columns to house the data coming from the CRM to be used in an inhouse CRM Tool.

The data itself is protected data but the table creations are available to be seen.
